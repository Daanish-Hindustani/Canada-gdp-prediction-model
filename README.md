Linear Regression for Predicting Canada's Per Capita Income
Objective: This project focuses on predicting Canada's per capita income for future years using a simple linear regression model.

Method: We employ linear regression to model the relationship between the year (independent variable) and per capita income (dependent variable). The model aims to find the best-fitting 
        linear equation that describes this relationship.

Data Source: Historical data from 'canada_per_capita_income.csv' provides the foundation for our predictions.

Implementation: The project utilizes Python for coding the linear regression model. The code and implementation can be found in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

Usage: You can use this model to predict Canada's per capita income for any desired future year, enabling economic analysis and forecasting.

Examples: Attached in the folder is a csv file which has entrys between 2020-2040, as well as the models predicted prices.
