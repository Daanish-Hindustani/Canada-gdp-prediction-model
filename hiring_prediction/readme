I developed a multivariate linear regression model that takes into account various factors to predict an individual's salary. This model incorporates the years of experience, test scores, and interview scores as input variables to generate salary predictions. By analyzing the relationships between these factors and salary outcomes, the model can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence compensation. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how experience, education, and interview performance collectively impact one's earnings. It's a powerful tool for both job seekers and employers to make informed decisions about compensation based on a data-driven understanding of the factors at play in salary determination.
