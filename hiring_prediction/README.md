# Multivariate linear regression salary Prediction model
Multivariate Linear Regression for Predicting Hiring salary
Objective: This project focuses on predicting the salary of different applicans unsing year of experience, test scores, and interview scores.

Method: We employ multivariate linear regression to model the relationship between the years of experience (independent variable), test scores (independent variable), interview scores (independent variable) and salary (dependent variable). The model aims to find the best-fitting 
        linear equation that describes this relationship.

Implementation: The project utilizes Python for coding the multivariate linear regression model. The code and implementation can be found in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

Usage: You can use this model to predict the expected salary of a wide array of applicants based on multiple variables.
